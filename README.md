Over the past 20+ years and numerous PCs, I've hoarded quite a digital mess!

Now the time has come to clean house, but I don't want to toss it all. Instead, it's a practical way to get in some ai/ml/dl practice. Just look at all of this wonderful data!

The goal is extract text from those files I have that contain text (PDFs, Word Docs, etc.), and then custer those documents. Tax documents, instruction manuals, and creative writings are some of the clusters I hope this experiment will identify.

In addition to gathering and prepping data to cluster, I wanted to get in some practice with pandas and vectorization rather than loops.
